                 <p>This week I learned from the courses materials that about Code blocks,
                    If a variable is declared inside a code block {...}, it’s only visible inside 
                    that block. and  it is  to isolate a piece of code that does its own task,
                    with variables that only belong to it , i also learn that without separate 
                    blocks there would be an error,
                   Another thing that i learned from this week materialsis that Currying
                  doesn’t call a function. It just transforms it.</p> 
                <h3>Question </h3>
